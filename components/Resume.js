        PASSION
        I have a desire to create a great scalable branding experience for companies.
        Branding is not just about a great logo, it also entails consistent look through out a website or suite of products.
        A great style/branding guide makes the UX better, because you change core concepts and not just the surface design.

        Education, willingness to experiment and a desire towards craftsmanship makes up who I am.
        To be able to prove a thoery is more important than being able to win debates because of a silver-tongue.
